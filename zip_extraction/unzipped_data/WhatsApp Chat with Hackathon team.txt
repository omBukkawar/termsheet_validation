29/05/2025, 19:18 - Pavankumar (CS-A): Hello guys,

We need to start preparing for upcoming hackathons in July-This is the right time!

My plan is to begin with a project , so I would like to schedule a meeting to discuss regarding that.

What time would work for all?
29/05/2025, 20:08 - Sneha: How about we first build our tech stack and then move towards project?
29/05/2025, 21:26 - Pavankumar (CS-A): My plan is that first we would finalize a problem statement and then work on it with following deadlines

Learning through project would be best because we would be able to understand what difficulties may arise in project.
29/05/2025, 21:28 - Pavankumar (CS-A): Whatever tech stack project requires we can learn that within deadlines 

Project ke liye jo bhi lag raha vo side by side sikhte jayenge .

Minimum use of AI karke project banana hai 

As hackathons require deadlines to be followed <This message was edited>

Figuring out how to extract from gmails and chats

I found that we can download mails in gmail and we will get .eml files  and we should open WhatsApp chats in phone in order to export them. <This message was edited>
